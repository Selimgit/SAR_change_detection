## Change Detector

## Overview

This python package is a lightweight and quick (~5seconds without GPU) **change detector**. IT has been designed to detect changes between two satellite images, specifically for **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data**. By leveraging SAR amplitude information and the Isolation Forest algorithm, this package allows users to identify areas of change effectively. It is particularly useful for those working in remote sensing, environmental monitoring, agriculture, or urban planning.

The function returns a detailed change map that highlights regions of appearance and disappearance, helping users gain insights into landscape dynamics.

## Features

- Detects changes between two SAR images using amplitude information.
- Uses Isolation Forest to classify areas of significant change.
- Identifies changes as either appearance or disappearance.
- Customizable parameters such as filter size and contamination level for fine-tuning.

Inputs are two satellite images (as np arrays) with the same size and from the same area. Then the code computes a ratio using amplitudes SAR information* and therefore Isolation Forest.

* The ratio of the arithmetic mean to the geometric mean of the spatially averaged intensities. The asymmetric term focuses more specifically on amplitude variations.
It helps to assess how the arithmetic mean of the intensities compares to their geometric mean. A value close to 1 would indicate an almost perfect equality between these means, suggesting uniformity in the amplitudes of the analyzed images.

## Installation

You can install the package with:

    pip install SAR-change-detector


## Requirements

Installation on the following Python dependencies:

    numpy
    scikit-learn
    scipy

# Usage

## Example

You can download the tutorial folder or directly test the function on Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Selimgit/SAR_change_detection/blob/main/tutorial/Tutorial_Change_Detector.ipynb).

The tutorial folder contains example images and a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the change detection function.

### Second date

## Results

The output is a change map where:

    -1 indicates areas where changes involve disappearance.
    0 indicates no change.
    1 indicates areas where changes involve appearance.

## 3 Parameters

    first_image, second_image: The two SAR satellite images to compare. 
    These should be np.array objects with the same size, from the same region of interest
    at 2 different acquisition times.

    filter_size: The size of the filter used in the asymmetric term computation (default is (3, 3)).

    contamination: The proportion of points to consider as anomalies for Isolation Forest. Default is 0.02.
